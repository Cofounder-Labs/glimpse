  "workflow_analysis": "This workflow navigates to Yahoo Mail by first searching it on Google and following the link to Yahoo Mail's official website. The key actions involve navigating to a Google search for 'Yahoo Mail,' clicking the first search result which leads to Yahoo Mail, and proceeding to an informational page about Yahoo Mail.\n\nTo streamline this process, the workflow can start directly from Yahoo Mail's URL to avoid unnecessary steps that replicate a typical Google search process or could be initiated by direct navigation to Yahoo Mail, given it's a fixed endpoint.\n\nNo dynamic user inputs are needed since the ultimate goal is to land on a static URL, \"https://overview.mail.yahoo.com/\". Therefore, the input_schema remains empty here since it doesn't need adjustment based on dynamic data or user-specific inputs. All navigation steps appear to be predetermined as part of a standard route\u2014thus simplifying the workflow without needing input alterations or further optional configurations.",
